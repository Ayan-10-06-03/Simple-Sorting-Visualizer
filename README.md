# Simple-Sorting-Visualizer

A web-based **Sorting Visualizer** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users understand how various sorting algorithms work. This interactive tool allows users to generate arrays of different sizes and visualize the sorting process at different speeds using animations.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Customizable Options:**
  - Choose array size (5 to 100 elements)
  - Select visualization speed (0.5x to 4x)
  - Generate a new random array

- **Responsive Design:** Works well across all screen sizes.

- **Interactive UI:** Includes color-coded states for current, minimum, visited, and sorted elements for clear understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
